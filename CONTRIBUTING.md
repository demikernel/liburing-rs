Contributing
=============

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project.

Bellow, you find some guidelines to help you on this.

Special Branches
-----------------

There are three special branches in this project:

- `master`: which you get all extensively-tested features
- `unstable`: which includes beta features
- `dev`: where all changes are introduced first

From a practical point of view, you should use these branches as follows:

- Rely on `master` whenever you want to use this project in a stable environment.

- Get `unstable` whenever you want to use this project in an experimental environment.

- Use `dev` whenever you want to introduce changes to this project.

Naming Branches
----------------

We rely on a naming convention for branches in order to:
- make it easier to navigate across the history of the project, and
- automatically run continuous integration workflows.

In a nutshell, branches that follow this convention are named according to their purpose:

- `feature-<module>-<issue>` for new features
- `enhancement-<module>-<issue>` for improvements on an existing feature
- `bugfix-<module>-<issue>` for permanent bug fixes on existing features
- `workaround-<module>-<issue>` for temporary bug fixes on existing features

Submitting Pull Requests

- Create a branch from `dev` with your changes.

- Use naming conventions stated in this guide to name your branch.

- Add your changes to your local branch.

- Open a pull request from your branch to `dev`.
